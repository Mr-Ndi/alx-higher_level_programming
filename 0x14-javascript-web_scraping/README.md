JavaScript web scraping is a method of extracting data from websites using JavaScript and Node.js. It involves installing Node.js, fetching HTML code using Axios, and parsing the HTML using libraries like Cheerio or Puppeteer. These libraries allow developers to efficiently scrape data from websites, with Puppeteer being particularly useful for websites that rely heavily on JavaScript.
